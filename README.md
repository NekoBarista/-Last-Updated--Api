# -Last-Updated--Api
A basic API to Javascript change dates to "last updated"- to be readable and easily useable by beginners.

So basically - I was doing an online Javascript Tutorial, and I got super cross that he hadn't updated it since 2018 so the library to do this for you, he was telling you to use to do this doesn't exist anymore.
<p>
(It was not a free course!)
  </p>
  <p>
There were answers in the student Q+A which pointed to a different library to do the same thing, which was also broken.
</p>
<p>
So I made this, to change javascript dates to "last update X ago."
</p>
<p>Is it attractive? No</p>
 <p>But - is it the best solution? Also no.</p>
<p> Could somebody else have done it better?  Definitely yes, but this is what I made, with the limited knowledge of someone just trying to do a tutorial (which they paid for)</p>
<p>
It's very simple, you can import the function however you like, the use case presented would print it to a h1, obviously.  You can see it used in by Javascript-Notepad GitHub repository, if you wanted to see a proper use case. </p>

<p>
For the newbies - its a seperate function in a new file (if you copy and paste it to a new file), so make sure to add it to your index.html as a script-src if you're doing vanilla javascript. </p>


I may spite work on this and make it better coding in the future.</p>

<p>
Please, if you make people pay for your courses, update them.  Or else, you are the reason for bad code like this existing.</p>

<p>
Anyway, if you can see a use for this, you are welcome to it.  If you drop me a line to let me know, or a thank you link, alls the better.  Or if that's not normally done, then just do whatever, I have no idea. I'm still doing tutorials, as you can see.</p>
