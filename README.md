# -Last-Updated--Api
A basic API to Javascript change dates to "last updated"- to be readable and easily useable by beginners.

So basically - I was doing an online Javascript Tutorial, and I got super cross that he hadn't updated in since 2018 and the library he was telling you to use to do this doesn't exist anymore.
<p>
(It was not a free course!)
  </p>
  <p>
There were answers in the student Q+A which pointed to a different library to do the same thing, which was also broken.

<p>
So I made this, to change javascript dates to "last update X ago."
</p>
<p>Is it attractive? No</p>
 <p>But - is it the best solution? Also no.</p>
<p> Could somebody else have done it better?  Definitely yes, but this is what I made, with the limited knowledge of someone just trying to do a tutorial (which they paid for)</p>
<p>
It's basically simple, you can import the function however you like, the use case presented would print it to a h1, obviously.  You can see it used in by Notepad GitHub repository, if you wanted to see a test case. </p>

<p>
At the moment, it doesn't go minute by minute - it has jumps between "a few seconds ago" to "30 seconds" to "1 minute" then "5 minutes" and so on, getting further spaced apart.  If you wanted to add more lines so it was more specific in it's timing - you go right ahead.</p>
<p>
I may spite work on this and make it more precise in the future.</p>

<p>
Please, if you make people pay for your courses, update them.  Or else, you are the reason for code like this existing.</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you can see a use for this, you are welcome to it.  If you drop me a line to let me know, or a thank you link, alls the better.  Or if that's not normally done, then just do whatever, I have no idea. I'm still doing tutorials, as you can see.</p>
