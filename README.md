So basically - I was doing an online Javascript Tutorial, and I got super cross that he hadn't updated in since 2018.
(It was not a free course!)
There were answers in the student Q+A which pointed to a different library to do exactly this, which was also broken.

So I made this, to do the same thing.

It's basically simple, you can import the function however you like, the use case presented would print it to a h1, obviously.

Please, if you make people pay for your courses, update them.
